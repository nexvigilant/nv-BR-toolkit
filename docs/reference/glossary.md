    Key terms and definitions used in benefit-risk assessment. Terms are organized alphabetically with cross-references to related concepts.

---

## A

**Absolute Risk**
:   The probability of an event occurring in a specified population over a defined time period, expressed as a percentage or rate (e.g., 5% over 2 years). Contrast with *Relative Risk*.

**Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)**
:   A noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product at doses normally used for prophylaxis, diagnosis, therapy, or modification of physiological function. Distinguished from *Adverse Event* by established causal relationship.

**Adverse Event (AE)**
:   Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Includes all undesirable experiences, regardless of causality.

---

## B

**Baseline Risk**
:   The probability of an outcome occurring in the absence of the intervention being evaluated. Essential for calculating absolute risk reduction and NNT.

**Benefit**
:   A favorable effect of a medicinal product. In B-R assessment, benefits are typically defined in terms of efficacy outcomes that matter to patients (e.g., symptom relief, survival, functional improvement).

**Benefit-Risk Assessment (BRA)**
:   Systematic evaluation of the benefits and risks of a medicine to determine whether the expected benefits outweigh the potential risks for the intended population and indication.

**Benefit-Risk Balance**
:   The overall determination of whether benefits outweigh risks, considering the magnitude and importance of each outcome, the population context, and available alternatives.

**BRAD (Benefit-Risk Action Document)**
:   A standardized template for documenting B-R evaluations, providing consistent structure for capturing decision context, evidence, and rationale. Used by FDA and other regulators.

---

## C

**Causality Assessment**
:   The evaluation of the likelihood that a medicinal product caused an observed adverse event. Methods include WHO-UMC system, Naranjo algorithm, and clinical judgment.

**CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences)**
:   An international nongovernmental organization that provides guidance on drug safety and benefit-risk assessment. CIOMS Working Group XII established foundational B-R framework.

**Clinical Significance**
:   The practical importance of an effect to patients and clinical practice, distinct from *statistical significance*. An effect can be statistically significant but clinically negligible, or vice versa.

**Comparator**
:   The treatment against which the intervention is compared. May be placebo, active control, standard of care, or best supportive care. Choice of comparator affects interpretation of B-R.

**Composite Endpoint**
:   A clinical trial endpoint combining multiple outcomes into a single measure (e.g., MACE = death + MI + stroke). *DOOR* analysis respects hierarchy within composite endpoints.

**Confidence Interval**
:   A range of values within which the true effect is likely to lie, given the observed data. Wider intervals indicate greater uncertainty.

---

## D

**Decision Context**
:   The first step in SBRF: defining the decision to be made, the target population, therapeutic alternatives, and stakeholder perspectives. Critical for framing the entire B-R evaluation.

**DOOR (Desirability of Outcome Ranking)**
:   A method for analyzing composite endpoints that assigns ordinal ranks to outcomes based on clinical hierarchy, then uses pairwise comparison to calculate win ratios. See [DOOR Analysis](../interactive/door-analysis.md).

**Dose-Response Relationship**
:   The relationship between the amount of drug administered and the magnitude of effect (benefit or risk). Understanding this relationship is essential for optimizing B-R balance.

---

## E

**Effects Table**
:   A structured presentation of benefits and risks with quantitative data, typically including outcome definition, incidence in treatment and control groups, relative and absolute measures, and confidence intervals. Core tool in SBRF.

| Outcome | Treatment | Comparator | Difference | 95% CI |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|--------|
| CV Death | 3.2% | 4.8% | -1.6% | (-2.4, -0.8) |
| Major Bleed | 2.1% | 0.9% | +1.2% | (0.6, 1.8) |

**EMA (European Medicines Agency)**
:   The EU regulatory authority responsible for scientific evaluation of medicines. Uses effects tables in CHMP assessment reports.

**Endpoint**
:   A measured outcome in a clinical trial used to evaluate efficacy or safety. Endpoints may be primary (main measure of effect) or secondary (supporting measures).

---

## F

**FDA (Food and Drug Administration)**
:   The US regulatory authority responsible for drug approval. FDA's Benefit-Risk Assessment Framework (2013) operationalizes structured B-R evaluation.

**Forest Plot**
:   A graphical display of treatment effects across multiple studies or subgroups, showing point estimates and confidence intervals. Commonly used to visualize meta-analysis results.

---

## G

**Generalizability**
:   The extent to which trial results apply to populations beyond those studied. Trial populations may differ from real-world patients in age, comorbidities, and concomitant medications.

---

## H

**Hazard Ratio (HR)**
:   A measure of the instantaneous risk of an event in the treatment group relative to the control group, derived from survival analysis. HR < 1 indicates reduced risk with treatment.

**Hierarchy (Outcome)**
:   In DOOR analysis, the ordered ranking of outcomes from most to least desirable. Establishing hierarchy requires explicit clinical judgment and stakeholder input.

---

## I

**ICH (International Council for Harmonisation)**
:   Organization that develops harmonized guidelines for pharmaceutical development across regions. ICH E2C(R2) addresses B-R in periodic reports.

**Incidence**
:   The number of new cases of an event occurring in a population over a defined time period. Distinguished from *prevalence* (total cases at a point in time).

**Indication**
:   The specific disease, condition, or patient population for which a medicine is approved. B-R balance may differ across indications for the same product.

---

## L

**Lifecycle Approach**
:   The principle that B-R assessment should evolve continuously as new data emerges throughout a product's lifecycle—from development through post-marketing. CIOMS WG XII key recommendation.

---

## M

**MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis)**
:   Quantitative method for B-R evaluation that assigns weights to different outcomes and combines them into an overall score. Useful for explicit value trade-offs but requires careful weight elicitation. See [Module 5: Visualization Tools](../modules/05-visualization-tools.md).

**MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities)**
:   Standardized medical terminology used for coding adverse events in regulatory submissions. Organized in hierarchy: System Organ Class → High Level Term → Preferred Term.

---

## N

**NNH (Number Needed to Harm)**
:   The number of patients who need to receive treatment for one additional patient to experience an adverse outcome compared to control. Lower NNH = higher risk. Calculated as 1/Absolute Risk Increase.

**NNT (Number Needed to Treat)**
:   The number of patients who need to receive treatment for one additional patient to benefit compared to control. Lower NNT = greater benefit. Calculated as 1/Absolute Risk Reduction.

| NNT | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| < 10 | Large benefit |
| 10-50 | Moderate benefit |
| > 50 | Small benefit |

**Net Benefit**
:   In DOOR analysis, the difference between the probability that a treatment patient has a better outcome and the probability that a control patient has a better outcome. Range: -1 to +1.

---

## O

**Odds Ratio (OR)**
:   The ratio of the odds of an event occurring in the treatment group to the odds in the control group. OR approximates RR when events are rare.

**Outcome**
:   A measurable result of treatment, including both benefits (efficacy outcomes) and risks (safety outcomes). Outcomes should be defined in patient-relevant terms.

---

## P

**Patient Preferences**
:   The relative importance patients place on different outcomes. Patient preferences may differ from clinician assumptions and should inform B-R assessment. See [Module 3: Decision Support](../modules/03-decision-support.md).

**PBRER (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report)**
:   ICH E2C(R2) mandated report submitted periodically during the post-authorization period, providing comprehensive B-R evaluation of a medicinal product.

**Pharmacovigilance**
:   The science and activities relating to detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects or other drug-related problems.

**Placebo**
:   An inactive treatment used as a comparator in clinical trials to control for placebo effect and establish true treatment effect.

**Propensity Score**
:   A statistical method to reduce confounding in observational studies by balancing treatment groups on measured covariates.

---

## R

**Relative Risk (RR)**
:   The ratio of the probability of an event in the exposed (treatment) group to the probability in the unexposed (control) group. RR = 1 indicates no difference; RR < 1 indicates reduced risk.

**Risk**
:   In pharmacovigilance, the probability of harm or other undesirable outcome occurring. In B-R assessment, risks are adverse outcomes that offset benefits.

**Risk Minimization Measure (RMM)**
:   Interventions designed to reduce the probability or severity of adverse reactions. Examples: REMS (US), additional risk minimization measures (EU).

**Robustness**
:   The stability of results across different assumptions, methods, or subgroups. Sensitivity analyses test robustness of B-R conclusions.

---

## S

**Safety**
:   The characteristic of a medicinal product reflecting an acceptable level of risk when used according to approved labeling.

**SBRF (Structured Benefit-Risk Framework)**
:   A systematic six-step process for B-R assessment: (1) Decision context, (2) Identify outcomes, (3) Data sources, (4) Outcome importance, (5) Outcome probability, (6) Integrate B-R.

**Sensitivity Analysis**
:   Analysis that tests how changes in assumptions, weights, or included data affect B-R conclusions. Essential for understanding uncertainty.

**Signal**
:   Information from one or more sources suggesting a new potentially causal association, or new aspect of a known association, between an intervention and an event.

**Statistical Significance**
:   The probability that an observed effect occurred by chance, typically expressed as p-value. Conventionally, p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

**Stakeholder**
:   Any party with an interest in B-R evaluation, including patients, healthcare providers, regulators, payers, and manufacturers. Different stakeholders may have different perspectives on outcome importance.

---

## T

**Therapeutic Index**
:   The ratio between the dose that produces toxicity and the dose that produces the desired effect. Narrow therapeutic index drugs require careful B-R management.

**Tornado Diagram**
:   A horizontal bar chart showing how changes in individual parameters affect the overall result. Used in sensitivity analysis to identify key drivers of B-R.

**Transparency**
:   CIOMS WG XII principle that decision rationale should be documented clearly, enabling stakeholders to understand and evaluate B-R conclusions.

---

## U

**Uncertainty**
:   The degree of imprecision in estimated effects due to sampling variability, measurement error, or model assumptions. Uncertainty should be quantified (e.g., confidence intervals) and communicated.

**Unmet Medical Need**
:   A condition for which there is no satisfactory treatment available, or for which existing treatments are inadequate. B-R tolerance may be higher for conditions with high unmet need.

---

## V

**Value Tree**
:   A hierarchical representation of benefit and risk factors, organizing outcomes into categories and subcategories. Useful for ensuring comprehensive outcome identification and structuring MCDA.

## W

**Weight**
:   In MCDA, the relative importance assigned to different outcomes. Weights may be elicited from patients, clinicians, or other stakeholders using methods like swing weighting or conjoint analysis.

**Win Ratio**
:   In DOOR analysis, the ratio of treatment wins to control wins from pairwise comparisons. Win ratio > 1 indicates treatment advantage; WR = 1.5 means treatment wins 50% more often than control.
