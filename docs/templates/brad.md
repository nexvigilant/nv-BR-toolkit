## What is a BRAD?

The **Benefit-Risk Action Document** was developed by FDA to provide a standardized structure for:

- Documenting B-R assessments throughout development
- Communicating with regulatory agencies
- Supporting internal decision-making
- Creating a living record that evolves with new data
