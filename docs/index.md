!!! tip "🎓 NexVigilant Academy Preview"

    **This toolkit represents an early preview of the learning and development materials that will be available through NexVigilant Academy.**

    We're building a comprehensive capability development platform for pharmacovigilance professionals. This Benefit-Risk Intelligence Toolkit demonstrates our commitment to rigorous, evidence-based educational content.

    *Please pardon our delay in the full Academy launch—our Chief Capability Officer, Dr. Vigil Alexander, took a short holiday during his first week on the job. The generation simply doesn't want to WORK anymore...* :material-emoticon-wink:

    **Stay tuned for the full Academy experience at [nexvigilant.com](https://www.nexvigilant.com)**
