### Module 1: Leadership Briefing

??? question "What are the five CIOMS WG XII recommendations?"

    1. **Adopt a structured approach** — Use SBRF or equivalent framework
    2. **Consider a lifecycle approach** — B-R evolves from development through post-marketing
    3. **Customize to context** — Adapt methods to the specific decision
    4. **Engage stakeholders** — Include patient and HCP perspectives
    5. **Document transparently** — Capture methodology, assumptions, and limitations

    📖 *Review: [Module 1](01-leadership-briefing.md)*

### Module 2: Foundation

??? question "What are the six steps of the Structured Benefit-Risk Framework (SBRF)?"

    1. **Decision Context** — What decision? For whom? Compared to what?
    2. **Identify Outcomes** — Benefits and risks that matter
    3. **Data Sources** — Evidence quality and availability
    4. **Outcome Importance** — Relative importance of each outcome
    5. **Outcome Probability** — How likely is each outcome?

    📖 *Review: [Module 2](02-foundation.md)*

### Module 3: Decision Support

??? question "When should you use DOOR vs. MCDA?"

    **Use DOOR when:**

    - Composite endpoints with natural hierarchy (e.g., death > hospitalization > symptoms)
    - Patient values relatively uniform
    - Want to avoid arbitrary numerical weights

    **Use MCDA when:**

    - Multiple stakeholder groups with different values
    - Need explicit, transparent weighting
    - Trade-offs between qualitatively different outcomes

    📖 *Review: [Module 3](03-decision-support.md)*

### Module 4: Assessment Templates

    | Template | Purpose |
    |----------|---------|
    | **BRAD** | Benefit-Risk Action Document — Living document for regulatory decisions |
    | **Effects Table** | Structured data presentation — Quantifies benefits and risks |
    | **Value Tree** | Hierarchical outcome map — Identifies all relevant outcomes |

    📖 *Review: [Module 4](04-assessment-templates.md)*

### Module 5: Visualization Tools

??? question "Match the visualization to the purpose:"

    | Visualization | Best For |
    |---------------|----------|
    | **Forest Plot** | Relative measures (RR, OR, HR) with confidence intervals |
    | **Tornado Diagram** | Sensitivity analysis — which inputs drive uncertainty |
    | **Heatmap** | Multi-attribute comparison across alternatives |
    | **Radar Chart** | Stakeholder profile comparison across criteria |

    📖 *Review: [Module 5](05-visualization-tools.md)*

### Module 6: Case Studies

??? question "What method was used in each case study?"

    | Case Study | Product Type | Method |
    |------------|--------------|--------|
    | **NEXCOAG** | Anticoagulant | DOOR (composite: bleeding events) |
    | **NEXONC** | Oncology immunotherapy | MCDA (stakeholder preferences) |
    | **NEXVAX** | Vaccine | SBRF (population-level assessment) |

    📖 *Review: [Module 6](06-case-studies.md)*

### Module 8: Regulatory Reference

??? question "What are the key differences between FDA and EMA B-R frameworks?"

    | Aspect | FDA | EMA |
    |--------|-----|-----|
    | **Framework** | 5 Dimensions (PDUFA) | PrOACT-URL |
    | **Effects Table** | Encouraged | Required |

## Part 4: Scenario-Based Quiz

Test your understanding with these scenario-based questions:

### Question 1: Framework Application

!!! question "Scenario"

    A sponsor is developing an effects table for a new diabetes drug. They have efficacy data at Week 24 and Week 52, but safety data only through Week 24.

    **What is the most appropriate approach?**

    A. Use Week 52 for efficacy and Week 24 for safety, noting the different timepoints
    B. Use only Week 24 data for both to maintain consistency
    C. Extrapolate safety data to Week 52 using modeling
    D. Present two separate effects tables for different timepoints

<details>
<summary>Click for answer and explanation</summary>

**Answer: A or D (both acceptable, A preferred)**

**Explanation:** Transparency is key. Option A is pragmatic—use the best available data while clearly documenting the different timepoints. Option D provides maximum transparency but may be cumbersome. Option B discards valuable efficacy data. Option C introduces modeling assumptions that may not be justified.

**Key principle:** Always document limitations and timepoint differences in effects tables.
</details>

---

### Question 2: Method Selection

!!! question "Scenario"

    You're assessing a vaccine with these characteristics:
    - Primary endpoint is a composite (infection + hospitalization + death)
    - Patient values are relatively uniform (everyone wants to avoid disease)
    - Regulatory submission requires quantitative B-R

    **Which method is most appropriate?**

    A. MCDA with equal weights
    B. DOOR analysis
    C. Effects table only
    D. Qualitative narrative

<details>
<summary>Click for answer and explanation</summary>

**Answer: B (DOOR analysis)**

**Explanation:** DOOR is ideal when:
- There's a composite endpoint with natural hierarchy (death > hospitalization > infection)
- Stakeholder values are relatively aligned (don't need MCDA's explicit weighting)
- You want to avoid arbitrary numerical weights

MCDA would add complexity without much benefit since values are uniform. Effects table alone doesn't leverage the hierarchy. Qualitative narrative doesn't meet the quantitative requirement.
</details>

---

### Question 3: Communication

!!! question "Scenario"

    Your B-R analysis shows NNT = 15 for the primary efficacy endpoint and NNH = 200 for a serious adverse event.

    **Which statement best communicates this to a patient advisory board?**

    A. "The relative benefit exceeds the relative risk by a factor of 13"
    B. "For every 15 people treated, 1 additional person benefits; for every 200 treated, 1 experiences a serious side effect"
    C. "The NNT/NNH ratio of 0.075 indicates favorable benefit-risk"
    D. "Efficacy is statistically significant with p<0.001"

<details>
<summary>Click for answer and explanation</summary>

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:** Patient audiences understand concrete numbers better than ratios or statistical jargon. Option B translates NNT/NNH into relatable terms—"for every X people..."

Option A is technically correct but abstract. Option C uses jargon patients won't understand. Option D addresses statistical significance, not clinical meaningfulness.

**Key principle:** Translate statistics into patient-friendly language without losing accuracy.
</details>

---

### Question 4: Risk Management

!!! question "Scenario"

    A new biologic has a serious but rare risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in immunocompromised patients. The risk appears to be higher in patients who previously received certain immunosuppressants.

    **What RMM approach is most appropriate?**

    A. Add warning to label only (routine RMM)
    B. Contraindication for all immunosuppressed patients
    C. Targeted RMM: screening checklist, HCP guide, patient alert card
    D. Restricted distribution with prescriber certification (REMS)

<details>
<summary>Click for answer and explanation</summary>

**Answer: C (Targeted RMM)**

**Explanation:** The risk is serious but predictable (associated with specific prior treatments). A targeted RMM enables:
- Screening checklist to identify high-risk patients
- HCP education on monitoring
- Patient awareness of symptoms

Option A (label only) is insufficient for a serious risk. Option B (blanket contraindication) may be overly restrictive since not all immunocompromised patients are at high risk. Option D (REMS) may be excessive if targeted measures can adequately mitigate risk.

**Key principle:** RMMs should be proportionate to the risk and targeted to those who can act on the information.
