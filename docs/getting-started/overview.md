# Overview

## What is Benefit-Risk Assessment?

**Benefit-Risk Assessment (BRA)** is the systematic evaluation of the benefits and risks of a medicinal product throughout its lifecycle. It informs regulatory decisions about marketing authorization, labeling, and ongoing safety monitoring.

!!! info "Key Principle"

    The goal of BRA is not to eliminate risk, but to ensure that the benefits of a medicine outweigh its risks for the intended patient population.

## Why This Toolkit?

Traditional BRA approaches often rely on implicit judgments and inconsistent methods. This toolkit operationalizes the **CIOMS Working Group XII** recommendations to provide:

- **Structured frameworks** for systematic assessment
- **Quantitative methods** for transparent decision-making
- **Visualization tools** for effective communication
- **Hands-on exercises** for practical skill development

## Key Methodologies Covered

### 1. Structured Benefit-Risk Framework (SBRF)

A 6-step systematic process:

1. Define the decision context
2. Identify benefits and risks
3. Identify data sources
4. Assess outcome importance
5. Assess outcome probability
6. Integrate benefit-risk

### 2. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)

Quantitative methodology that:

- Assigns weights to outcomes based on stakeholder values
- Scores treatments on each outcome
- Calculates weighted aggregate scores
- Enables transparent trade-off analysis

### 3. DOOR Analysis

Desirability of Outcome Ranking:

- Ranks patient outcomes hierarchically
- Uses pairwise comparison between treatment groups
- Produces intuitive "win ratio" metrics
- Preserves clinical ordering without arbitrary weights

## Who Is This For?

| Audience | Use Case |
